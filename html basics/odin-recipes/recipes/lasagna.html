    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <h4>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, then
                drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and
                cook until the onion is translucent and the beef is fully cooked. Drain any excess fat from the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer
                the
                sauce for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese.
                Mix
                well until evenly blended.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over
                the
                noodles. Repeat these layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the
                foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and
                serving.
                Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this scrumptious lasagna with a side of garlic bread and a fresh salad for a complete meal.</li>
            <br>

            classic that will have everyone coming back for seconds!
